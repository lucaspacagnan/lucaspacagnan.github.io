<p style='text-align: justify;'> 

I'm an MPhil Student at State University of Londrina (UEL) in Brazil and a researcher at [GEFIL](https://gefilblog.wordpress.com/) (a research group on Ethics, Legal e Political philosophy at UEL).

My research is focused on metatheoretical issues evolving a descriptive theory of law and the proper role of conceptual analysis in jurisprudence.

Besides that, I'm a lawyer specialised in tax law with practice in civil and administrative law too.

Non-professional nor academic interests include stock and options market, Premier League & Rush.
